        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. It is widely used for system/software development, game engines, and real-time simulations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s as an extension of the C language. It introduced classes and other features to support better software design and reuse.</p>
