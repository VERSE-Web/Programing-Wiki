            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language created by Guido van Rossum to simplify the coding process. It has become one of the most widely used languages in the world thanks to its clear syntax, strong community, and broad range of applications. Whether you're building a website or training a machine learning model, Python is a powerful tool that makes programming more accessible to everyone.</p>

            <h2>Who Made Python?</h2>
            <img src="../assets/Guido.jpg" alt="Guido van Rossum" class="creator-img">
            <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. He began working on it during his holiday break in December 1989 and released the first version in 1991. Guido wanted to create a language that was powerful yet easy to use, and he continued to lead the development of Python for many years, earning the nickname “Benevolent Dictator For Life” (BDFL) within the Python community.</p>

            <h2>Why Was It Made?</h2>
            <p>Python was created to make programming more accessible and efficient. At the time, many programming languages were either too complex for beginners or too rigid for rapid development. Python was designed to bridge this gap by focusing on code readability and reducing the cost of program maintenance. It allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java.</p>

            <h2>What is Python?</h2>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and more. Its syntax is designed to be clear and easy to understand, making it a popular choice for beginners as well as professional developers.</p>
